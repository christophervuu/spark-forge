# SPEC

## Title

Short descriptive name for the change.

---

## ID

FS-###  
Assigned sequentially. `FS` = Feature Spec.

---

## Metadata

Owner: @name-or-team  
Reviewers: @name-or-team  
Created: YYYY-MM-DD  
Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD

If unknown during early drafting, use `TBD`.

---

## Status

draft | refining | ready | in_progress | completed | archived

- `draft` = initial spec created, not yet refined
- `refining` = questions, tradeoffs, or repo grounding still being resolved
- `ready` = approved for task generation
- `in_progress` = one or more tasks are being executed
- `completed` = implementation and verification finished
- `archived` = retired, replaced, or no longer relevant

This status tracks the overall lifecycle of the change, not just document editing.

---

## Revision

Rev: 1

Rev bump required when any of the following materially change:

- intended behavior
- scope boundaries
- acceptance examples
- verification expectations
- materially affected system areas

See `Change Log` for revision history.

---

## Summary

2-4 sentences summarizing the change, why it exists, and what success looks like.

This should let someone understand the spec at a glance without reading the full document.

---

## Problem

Describe the current pain, gap, or limitation.

Focus on what is wrong or missing today.

---

## Goal

Describe the desired outcome of this change.

Focus on the observable result, not the implementation approach.

---

## Assumptions

List assumptions currently believed to be true that shape this spec.

Examples:
- existing identifiers remain stable
- current auth model remains unchanged
- current import size limits remain acceptable

If none:
- none

---

## Current Context

Describe the current system or workflow context relevant to this change.

Focus on what a task executor needs to know to understand why the current state is being changed — not a general system overview.

This may include:
- current user flow
- current system behavior
- relevant limitations
- existing related components or patterns
- repo findings or architectural constraints

---

## Scope

### In Scope

List the behaviors, flows, or system areas this spec will change.

### Out of Scope

List concrete items intentionally excluded from this iteration.

Use this for nearby work that could be mistaken as included.

---

## Non-Goals

List things this change is explicitly not trying to accomplish.

Use this for broader product or architecture directions that should not be inferred from this spec.

---

## Relevant Areas

List the files, modules, services, UI surfaces, or architecture areas likely affected.

Mark uncertain entries with `?` if confidence is low.

Examples:
- `apps/web/src/features/mapping-studio/*`
- `packages/schema-import/*`
- `backend/schema-validation/* ?`

---

## Dependencies / Blockers

List any specs, tasks, migrations, approvals, external systems, or decisions this work depends on.

Examples:
- Depends on FS-042 being completed first
- Requires backend endpoint for schema validation
- Waiting on product decision for conflict handling

If none:
- none

---

## Constraints

List constraints that shape the solution.

Examples:
- must preserve current routing structure
- must work with existing schema records
- no breaking API changes
- must remain compatible with current auth model

Include performance, compatibility, compliance, or operational constraints when relevant.

---

## Proposed Behavior

Describe the intended behavior after this change.

Use the following subheadings.

### User Flow

Describe how the user experiences the behavior.

### System Behavior

Describe how the system responds, stores data, validates input, or coordinates components.

### Failure / Edge Behavior

Describe behavior for invalid input, empty states, conflicts, partial data, missing dependencies, or error conditions.

This is required if any such case is possible.

---

## Acceptance Examples

Provide deterministic examples with stable IDs.

Use `AE-##` identifiers so tasks and tests can reference them directly.

Include as many examples as needed to fully specify the behavior. Three is not a target.

### AE-01 — Short descriptive name

**Given**
- ...

**When**
- ...

**Then**
- ...

### AE-02 — Short descriptive name

**Given**
- ...

**When**
- ...

**Then**
- ...

---

## Open Questions

List unresolved questions that block confidence or task generation.

Format:
- `Q1.` ...
- `Q2.` ...

Resolved questions should be removed from this section and captured in `Change Log`.

If none:
- none

---

## Verification Strategy

Describe how this spec will be validated.

At minimum, identify which acceptance examples require automated coverage and which are manual-only.

This may include:
- unit tests
- integration tests
- end-to-end tests
- build / typecheck / lint expectations
- manual verification steps
- observability or logging checks

Prefer mapping verification back to acceptance example IDs where practical.

---

## Task Generation Notes

Describe how this work should be decomposed into atomic tasks.

This section should guide decomposition, sequencing, and risk isolation. It must not become a hidden implementation plan or checklist.

This may include:
- suggested task boundaries
- sequencing constraints
- parallelizable areas
- risky areas that should remain isolated
- acceptance examples that should stay grouped together

---

## Change Log

Each revision entry should state what changed and why.
